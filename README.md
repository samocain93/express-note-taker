# Note Taker
An application using Express.js that can be used to write and save notes

## Description

This application will allow users to create and save notes on a webpage, providing a title and description along with each note. If the user decides to delete a note, they will have the option to delete a created note using the red trash icon next to the list of notes on the left of the page.

### User Story

- As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize and keep track of tasks I need to complete

### What I Learned
- Continued practice using Node.js and new Node packages
- Using the express Framework for the first time to create routes for a server
- Deploying a webpage to be hosted using Heroku
